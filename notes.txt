    # CHEKING FOR CONSISTENCY IN ANSWERS  
    #
    #   1  |  2         
    #   3  |  4         
    # 1 - Queries are inconsistent and != GOLD query    2 - Queries are inconsistent but == GOLD query
    # 3 - Queries are consistent but != GOLD query.     4 - Queries are consistent and == GOLD query
